# Hospital-Management
This is a simple Hospital Management System implemented in C. It allows you to manage patient records in a hospital, including adding, viewing, searching, and deleting patient information. The system uses a menu-driven approach and stores patient data in memory during program execution.<br/>

# Features
-> Add Patient: Allows adding new patient records with details such as ID, name, age, disease, and the assigned doctor.<br/>
-> View Patients: Displays all patient records currently stored in the system.<br/>
-> Search Patient: Allows searching for a specific patient by name.<br/>
-> Delete Patient: Deletes a patient record based on their unique ID.<br/>
-> Exit: Exits the program gracefully.<br/>
# Requirements
C Compiler: To compile and run the program, you will need a C compiler such as GCC.<br/>
Operating System: This program should work on most operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) with a C compiler installed.<br/>
